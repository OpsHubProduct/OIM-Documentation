# registerTFSWCFService.bat fails to install

## Problem

While installing the Service through the bat file, the installation fails with the following error:

* _An exception occurred while trying to find the installers in the C:\Program Files\OpshubPath\opshubtfsservice.exe assembly._
* _System.Reflection.ReflectionTypeLoadException: Unable to load one or more of the requested types. Retrieve the LoaderExceptions property for more information._
* _The Rollback phase of the installation is beginning_

And the service registration is roll backed.

## Resolution

This error usually occurs when you have *TFS Object Model 2013* installed on the machine unless you have **Team Foundation Server 2012** or **Visual Studio 2012** installed on the same machine.

It is strongly recommended that you install *TFS Object Model 2012* and uninstall all other object model installed in machine.

# I have TFS Object Model 2013 already installed

## Problem

This is the situation where you have *TFS Object Model 2013* already installed on the machine where you want to setup the service and while trying to install the *TFS Object Model 2012*, the installer stops because it detects a newer version of the Object Model already installed.

## Resolution

To resolve this issue, it is suggested that you uninstall the *TFS Object Model 2013* and then install the *TFS Object Model 2012* (as required by <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> Proxy Service)

Service will **NOT** work with TFS Object Model 2013.

## Problem

Error such as "Error coming was HRESULT E_FAIL has been returned from a call to a COM component".

## Resolution

Perform following steps to resolve the issue.

1. Exit Team Foundation Server. Stop OpsHubTFSService from the local service.
2. Open the command window and navigate to the folder: `%localappdata%\Microsoft\Team Foundation\X.0\Cache`. Here delete all sub-items in cache folder and empty it. Do this for all folders X.0 where X is version number i.e. 3.0, 4.0, etc.
