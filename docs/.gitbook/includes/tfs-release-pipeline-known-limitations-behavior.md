**Pre-requisite:**

Before starting synchronization, please make sure the following items already exist in the target environment.
These are required to in target due to Azure DevOps API Restrictions/limitations.

- **Azure Artifacts:** The feed and package must pre-exist in the target project.
  * The feed and package name can be the same as the source or a transformed name that OpsHub can use to look up and reference in target project during pipeline synchronization — for example, abc-package or Synced_abc-package.
- **Deployment Group:** If a release stage includes a Deployment Group Job, the same deployment group must pre-exist in the target project.
  * The group name can be the same as the source or a transformed name that OpsHub can use to look up and reference in target project during pipeline synchronization — for example, Prod-Deploy or Prod-Deploy-New.
- **Secure Files:** Secure files must pre-exist in the target system.
  * The file name can be the same as the source or a transformed name that OpsHub can use to look up and reference in target project during pipeline synchronization — for example, BuildKey or Synced_BuildKey
- **Azure Git Repositories** with matching names pre-existing in the target project
> Once the required data exists in the target environment, the synchronization automatically links/refers to the above components during Release Pipeline synchronization, ensuring no references are lost.
>
> **Note:** If any of the above resources do not exist in the target project, the sync operation will fail because the Release Pipeline depends on these resources for successful execution.

* Release Pipeline may contain reference of Query, Agent Pools, Service Connection, Task Group, Build Pipeline so these dependent entities must be synced before Release Pipeline to avoid the sync failure. **<code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code>** support all these dependent artifacts sync along with Release Pipeline.

**Known Behaviour and Limitations:**
  * Release Pipeline will be synced TFS version 2018 or above, as APIs are available from that version only.
  * Azure Artifact in release pipeline are supported from TFS version 2019 or above.
    * Reason: APIs for Azure Artifacts are supported from version 2019.
  * Agent Pool in release pipeline are supported from TFS version 2020 or above.
    * Reason: APIs for Azure Artifacts are supported from version 2020.
  * Release Pipeline does not have Attachments, Comments, and Inline images, hence Attachments, Comments, and Inline images won't be synchronization.
  * End System Criteria Storage is not supported.
    * Reason: Release Pipeline does not have any custom fields.
  * Impersonation is not supported.
    * Reason: ADO/TFS API limitation.
  * Synchronization of security permissions for individual Release Pipelines is not supported.
