Use the checklist below to diagnose common formatting or rendering issues in your documentation.

## 1. Page Not Visible
- Confirm the page is added to **SUMMARY.md**.
- Check indentation levels in SUMMARY.md.
- Ensure the filename and path are correct (case-sensitive).

## 2. Internal Links Not Working
- Verify the target file exists.
- Check that the file path is correct (e.g., `../folder/page.md`).
- Ensure section links match headings exactly (e.g., `#section-name`).

## 3. Images Not Loading
- Confirm the image is inside the **assets** folder.
- Check that the file name uses **lowercase** and contains **no spaces**.
- Ensure the relative path is correct based on the page location.

## 4. Table Formatting Issues
- Make sure all pipe characters (`|`) are aligned.
- Verify each row has the same number of columns.

## 5. Code Block Problems
- Ensure triple backticks (``` ) are correctly opened and closed.
- Use language tags only when needed (e.g., ```json, ```xml).

## 6. Layout or Spacing Issues
- Remove unnecessary blank lines.
- Follow correct heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3).

## 7. Anchor Link Issues
- Ensure headings are unique.
- Avoid using special characters in heading titles.
