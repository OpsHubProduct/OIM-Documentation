## Cause

*This issue occurs when upgrading <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> to version 7.78 or higher. It throws event failure as the query filters format is changed.*  
*The **query filters** for the particular query are not correctly selected.*

## Solution

Update the **query filters** as mentioned in the IBM ClearQuest Rational connector documentation. Refer to the [Queries Configuration](../../../../connectors/ibm-rational-clearquest.md#queries-configuration) section.
