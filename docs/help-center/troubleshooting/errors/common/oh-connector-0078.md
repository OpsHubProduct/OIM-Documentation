## Cause

When a Web Link is mapped with Standard Link, then incoming Web Link for synchronization in <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> will have limited details like link URL and link title. Standard Linkages are established based on issues that are synchronized by <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code>. As Web Link does not have enough information to establish the Standard Linkage, this combination is not supported.
