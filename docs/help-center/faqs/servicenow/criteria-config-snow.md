## Description

This describes how subset of entities can be synchronized based on certain criteria/condition.

## Solution

Criteria Configuration helps in integration of subset of entities based on pre-defined conditions.

For example, you can specify that only the incidents/problems with high priority are to be synchronized.

For steps on how to configure criteria, please refer [Criteria Configuration](../../../integrate/integration-configuration.md#criteria-configuration).

For the syntax of criteria query, please refer [ServiceNow Criteria Configuration](../../../connectors/servicenow.md#criteria-configuration).
