## Description

Integration is configured, now if any failure comes in synchronization or integration is active but it's not syncing any data. In such cases is there any way through which email notifications are sent to the stakeholders so that they can act on the issue?

## Solution

Failure Notification will be used to notify the user in following circumstances:  

1. In case of continuous failure while reading data from source system.  
2. When there is no activity performed on an active integration.  
3. When any failure occurs during synchronization.  

For complete steps on applying this configuration on integration, refer [Configure Failure Notification](../../troubleshooting/configure-post-failure-notification.md).
