## Description

If I create a new integration, then how frequently data is read from the source system and synchronized to the target system? In <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code>, this is referred as schedule of the integration. What will be the default schedule when a new integration is created?

## Solution

The default schedule will depend on the <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> edition you have.

1. If you have Free edition, then default schedule will be 5 minute.  
2. If you have an edition other than the Free edition, then default schedule will be 1 minute.
