## Description

Mapping is configured from system A to system B. Lookup type of fields such as 'Priority' to 'Priority' are being mapped. Now, if field values of both systems are different, for example, in System A the 'Priority' field has values like '1', '2', '3', '4', while in System B the 'Priority' field values are 'Critical', 'High', 'Medium', 'Low', then how can these values be mapped?

## Solution

Through value mapping configuration, you can map values of lookup type fields. You can map values like '1' to 'Critical', '2' to 'High', etc. For more information on how to configure value mapping, refer to [Value Mapping](../../../integrate/mapping-configuration.md#value-mapping).
