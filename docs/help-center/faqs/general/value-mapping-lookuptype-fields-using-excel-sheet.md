## Description

As of now, there is a limitation in value mapping for lookup type fields: a maximum of 100 values can be mapped. If the user wants to map more than 100 values, an Excel sheet can be used for this purpose.

## Solution

Please refer to [Value Mapping using an Excel Sheet](../../../integrate/mapping-configuration.md#value-mapping-using-excel-sheet).
