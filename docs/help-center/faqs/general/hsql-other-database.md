<code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> is installed on HSQL database. Now is there any way to migrate HSQL database to other supported database like MySQL, MSSQL, PostgreSQL or Oracle?  

## Solution

HSQL database can be used for evaluation purpose. It is not a scalable for production usage. If you have HSQL database and want to migrate to other database, then you can check out the [Database Migration](../../../manage/advanced-utilities/database-migration.md).
