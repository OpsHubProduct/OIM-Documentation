## Description

Integration is configured for system A and system B. Any entity created/updated in system A will be synchronized to system B through <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code>. Now, is there any way we can have System A's entity Id and entity URL in a custom field of system B and vice versa? This will help in easily navigating to the entity of the other system.

## Solution

It is possible to configure entity Id or entity URL or both in some custom field of the system. For more information, refer to [Tracking ID and Link](../../../integration-configuration.md#tracking-id-and-link).
