## Description

Azure DevOps systems provide the feature to edit and delete operation in comments.

## Solution

You can edit or delete discussion/comment from the systemsâ€™ User Interface.  
But right now <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code> does not provide this feature.  
Once any comment is created in Azure DevOps systems, it will not be updated or deleted by <code class="expression">space.vars.SITENAME</code>.
