# History – List API

## Overview
Returns history for the given entity type, filtered by project, entity id, time or user and sorted (if supported by end system) according to the given `orderByDirection`.

## API URI
```
GET: /entities/{entityTypeId}/history? 
     projectId=<projectId> 
     &entityId=<entityId> 
     &since=<sinceTime> 
     &maxTime=<maxTime> 
     &notUpdatedByUser=<notUpdatedByUser> 
     &startIndex=<startIndex> 
     &maxResults=<maxResults>
     &nextPageLink=<nextPageLink>
     &orderByDirection=<orderByDirection>
```

## URI Parameters
| Name              | In     | Required | Type     | Description |
|-------------------|--------|----------|----------|-------------|
| entityTypeId      | path   | True     | String   | ‘id’ of the entity type for the given entity id |
| entityId          | path   | False    | String   | ‘id’ of the entity for which history needs to be returned |
| projectId         | Query  | True     | String   | Project for which history needs to be returned |
| since             | Query  | False    | Datetime | Returns history that has occurred since this time (`history >= sinceTime`) |
| maxTime           | Query  | False    | Datetime | Returns history that occurred before or on this time (`history <= maxTime`) |
| notUpdatedByUser  | Query  | False    | String   | Returns history for updates that the given user did not do. The user’s username or email will be passed as per the `IntegrationUserDatatype` parameter in ServerInfo API |
| startIndex        | Query  | True     | Integer  | Starts index from where history items need to be returned |
| maxResults        | Query  | True     | Integer  | The number of history items from `startIndex` that needs to be returned |
| nextPageLink      | Query  | False    | String   | Link to the next page of the history list response. If connector returns the next page link in a response, in the subsequent paginated requests, OIM will pass that `nextPageLink`. `startIndex` and `pageSize` will still be passed along with `nextPageLink`. Connector can utilize this parameter so that for subsequent pages, it doesn't need to form the end system query again. |
| orderByDirection  | Query  | False    | String   | Sorts the history based on `orderByDirection`. Values: `ASC` or `DESC`. Sorting priority: 1. `CREATE_UPDATED_TIME` 2. `ENTITY_ID` 3. `REVISION_ID`. If not supported, set `sortableFields` as `null`. |

## Response Body

| Parent              | Name                   | Type     | Description |
|---------------------|------------------------|----------|-------------|
| revisions           |                        |          | Revisions should be sorted on `revisionDateTime`, `entityId`, and `revisionId` in ascending order. First compare `revisionDateTime`; if equal, compare `entityId`; if still equal, compare `revisionId`. |
|                     | entityId               | String   | 'id' of the entity for which the history record is returned. |
|                     | revisionId             | String   | Unique id to identify a revision if the end system does not maintain the revision id. |
|                     | updatedBy              | String   | Username of the user who created the given history record. |
|                     | revisionDateTime       | Datetime | Time at which the update was performed.<br><br>**Note:** When end system API does not provide information for revision of either of comments/attachments/links in the history API, provide dummy revision for these with providing the revisionDateTime when comment(s)/attachment(s)/link(s) has been created or updated for the entity whose history is returned. <br> For example, An entity E1's field F1 is updated at timestamp T1, and a comment C1 is added to E1 at timestamp T2 (T2 > T1), and history API only provides revision for field F1, then end system needs to provide dummy revision for the comment C1 as follows:<br><br>  { "entityId": "`<unique id of entity>`", "revisionId": "`<revision number>`", "updatedBy": "`<username of user who made the change>`",  "revisionDateTime": "`<revision time>`",  "revisionType": "CREATE / UPDATE"} |
|                     | revisionType           | Enum     | Type of revision: `CREATE` or `UPDATE`.<br><br>- **CREATE:** Send when the entity was created in this revision. This can be determined using system-specific rules (e.g., `revisionId` = 0 or matching entity creation time). If determination is not possible, send `UPDATE` instead.<br>- **UPDATE:** Entity was updated in this revision. |
|                     | fieldsChangedInRevision| Object   | Fields modified in this revision. If none were modified, can be empty. For each field, send `oldValue` (value before this revision) and `newValue` (value set in this revision). Multi-select fields should send full lists for both old and new values.<br><br>**For CREATE Revision:** Pass `null`.<br><br>For getting entity revisions using OIM utility: <br>- If the history response is complex to parse old and new field values, the complete history description can be returned by placing it in the "new values" under the field name "OH_HISTORY_DESCRIPTION"..<br><br>**Example:**<br> "OH_HISTORY_DESCRIPTION": {"oldValue": null, "newValue": "<history_description_string>"} |
|                     | attachmentRevision     | Object   | Returns the list of attachments that existed in the entity in the previous revision, in oldValue. <br> In newValue, send a list of attachments that exists as of this revision. If no attachment was added, deleted or modified in this revision OR the end system has a separate API for fetching attachment history, then attachmentRevision can be null |
|                     | commentRevision        | Object   | In newValue, send any comment newly added or modified in this revision. <br>If no comment was added or modified in this revision OR the end system has a separate API for fetching comments history, then commentRevision can be null |
|                     | linkRevision           | Object   | Returns the list of links that existed in the entity in the previous revision in oldValue.In newValue, send a list of existing links as of this revision. <br> If no link was added, deleted or modified in this revision OR the end system has a separate API for fetching link history, linkRevision can be null |
| nextPageLink        |                        |          | Link to the next page of the entity history response. <br> The connector should return the link of the next page exactly in the same way as it is returned from the end system. This is an optional field.<br> If the end system does not provide next page link in the list API, it can remain null. |
